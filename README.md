## Hi there 👋
Lucky to meet you！  

### about me? 👀  
I used to learn software engineering and focus on software applications developing.   
And I have done some deep learning personal experiments based on small-scale datasets.  

However, I'm currently working on computer architecture(or something related to it).  
This sounds a bit strange, huh? I never thought of it myself. But it's actually what I'm doing.
<!--
One day,I realized "hey, I can program via advanced programming languages, but I still know nearly nothing about hardware".
And another day, someone told me "you can learn it, but it's very hard".    

So I thought about it for a long time, then I decided to start spending a lot of effort to learn it-->

### My Hope ✨  
I would be glad if my repositories were helpful to you🤗
